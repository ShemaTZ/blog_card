## My process
I put everything under one big div and made that as a card and everything else the same that needed box then I progressed to style and made everything flexbox to make them follow each other and used the appropirate colors and fonts.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

The biggest thing I learned is how to add fonts porperly into css file and it is very impornt


```css
@font-face {
  font-family: 'Figtree';
  src: url('assets/fonts/Figtree-VariableFont_wght.ttf') format('truetype'),
       url('assets/fonts/Figtree-Italic-VariableFont_wght.ttf') format('truetype');
  font-weight: 100 900; /* Range for variable font */
  font-style: normal;
  font-display: swap;
}

@font-face {
  font-family: 'Figtree';
  src: url('assets/fonts/Figtree-Italic-VariableFont_wght.ttf') format('truetype');
  font-weight: 100 900;
  font-style: italic;
  font-display: swap;
}
